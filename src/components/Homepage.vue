        <p>My name is Mark Robitaille, and I am a fourth-year computer science student at the University of Manitoba. I am very interested in both web development and video game development.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">
          One of the things I value most is being a part of a community. For nearly two years, I have acted as vice president of the University of Manitoba Computer Science Studentsâ€™ Association (CSSA). This has given me a chance to meet many incredible people and coordinate events for students to enjoy, like game jams and social events. On top of that, I help maintain and promote our lounge and community to encourage new computer science students to mingle with and learn from more experienced students.
